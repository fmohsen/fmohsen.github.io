My research investigates the security and privacy risks of third-party applications in computing system by analyzing the access control mechanisms, finding possible vulnerabilities, implementing countermeasures, and studying users’ awareness and comprehension to the vulnerabilities and the countermeasures. Over the last 4 years I have been working on projects that involve using data and text mining techniques to detect Android malicious apps and recommend safe apps for mobile users to download on their phones.  As per my teaching, I have a good teaching record. I have 3 years of full time and five years of part time teaching experience at three different US institutes and University of Groningen, the Netherlands. I have taught various kinds of undergrad, grad and cross-listed courses including security. I taught these courses using three methods of teaching and learning: flipped classroom, lecturing, and online. . </span>

                <h3>Countering Intrusive Mobile Apps</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">In this project, we are proposing and evaluating
a new security-centric ranking algorithm built on top of the
Elasticsearch engine to assist users evade installing intrusive
apps. The algorithm calculates an intrusiveness score for
an app based on its requested permissions, received system
actions, and on the privacy preferences of users. In doing so,
we are proposing a new approach to capture users’ privacy
preferences. The approach is evaluated through an online
user study. The ranking algorithm is being evaluated on a
large corpus of Android apps contextual data and APK files
by conducting a pilot study and benchchmarking study. The
results show that the scoring and reranking steps add very
small overhead. Moreover, participants of the online and pilot
studies gave positive feedback for the ranking algorithm and
privacy preferences solicitation approach. The results suggest
that our proposal would definitely protect the privacy of mobile
users and pushes developers into requesting the minimum
privileges that are required for their apps to function.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fadi-Mohsen-Broadcasts-Viewer/dp/B00U6ALGPW" class="btn btn-danger">View</a>

                <p class="text-justify">In this paper, we are conducting an empirical study to investigate the usage patterns of the Broadcast receivers component by malicious and benign Android applications. In addition to processing the AndroidManifest. xml files, the source code of malware samples, in particular the onReceive() are manually analyzed. We also propose a data mining malware detection mechanism based on the statically registered Broadcast receivers. Our research shows that Android Broadcast receivers are intensively used by malware compared to benign applications. Our Java code analysis shows that malware samples fully utilize Broadcast receivers compared to benign apps. Finally, our experiments showed that using the Broadcast receivers with permissions improves the malwares prediction accuracy..</p><a href="#" class="btn btn-danger" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#journal_view7">View</a>

                <h3>Quantifying Information Exposure by Web Browsers</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Internet surfing entails exchanging numerous HTTP requests between clients and servers. Attached with each request is a string containing plenty of information about the client called User-Agent string. There have been numerous researches that showed the privacy and security risks of User-Agent strings. In this work we aim to minimize those risks by directing users towards using less exposing browsers. In doing so, we propose and test a new method for calculating an exposure score for web browsers based mainly on their User-Agent strings besides other attributes. We then apply this method on a dataset of over a million browsers to infer and compare their exposure scores. Finally, we present a demo web tool that shows how the resulting scores can be leveraged to aid end users. Our results reveal a variation in the exposure scores of these browsers, which creates prospect for safe Internet surfing..</p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SWR1vXfkBsZ7S_aCHhevIJqf7ZlArWd0">View</a>

                                    <p class="text-justify">Android provides finer-grained security features through a ”permission” mechanism that puts limitations on the resources that each application can access. Upon installing a new Android application, a user is prompted to grant it a set of permissions. There are two typical assumptions made regarding permissions and mobile application security and privacy. The first one is that malicious applications need to retain much permission. Secondly, mobile devices users assume that installed applications do not access data if they are not in the foreground. In this project, we showed that malicious Android applications can still fulfill their objectives with minimum permissions and that they can access user data while in the background. This could happen with the help of another Android component, called broadcast receiver [P1]. We studied the evaluation of Android broadcast actions. We demonstrated an attack scenario made possible by the broadcast receivers. Moreover, we developed an app to aid user identify the broadcasts receivers that are registered by the apps on their own Android devices called Broadcasts Viewer.

                                <p class="text-justify">Android has a large share in the mobile apps market which makes it attractive for both malicious and good developers. Online apps markets, despite their vetting procedures, still admit malicious apps that could be downloaded mistakenly by mobile users. Detecting Android malwares has been studied by many researchers using different approaches and techniques. The vast majority of them though were focused on using the requested permissions that are declared in the AndroidManifest. xml files. A number of researchers have considered other components of the Android applications besides the permissions such as package info, activities, and process name. Some researchers pointed out Android Broadcast receivers' component but it was not discussed thoroughly like other components. In this paper, we are conducting an empirical study to investigate the usage patterns of …</p>
